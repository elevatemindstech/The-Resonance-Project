> **As of • Last Quarter (Integration)**  
> This page describes the resonance of the moon cycle as a rhythm of being.  
> It offers two doorways: **Story** (everyday life rhythm) and **System** (framework for 4-week flow).

## Story Doorway
Everyone knows the feeling of **beginnings, surges, fullness, and endings**.  
Energy rises and falls in weeks, seasons, even in a single day. The moon simply gives us a **visible mirror** for these rhythms.  

- **New Moon → Beginnings.** Quiet, fertile, the seed of intention.  
- **First Quarter → Push.** Action, friction, energy invested.  
- **Full Moon → Illumination.** Things are revealed, outcomes visible.  
- **Last Quarter → Release.** Reflection, processing, integration.  

These shifts are not rigid switches but **gradients**. Each phase shades into the next, like dusk into night.  

By orienting to this cycle, people find their **life already in rhythm** — sleep, emotions, creativity, relationships often echo these tides. The moon offers a shared anchor.

## System Doorway
The moon cycle is also a **practical system for flow** — a natural 4-week scaffold that harmonizes with resonance principles.

### The 4-Phase Flow
- **New (Week 1): Intention.** Define goals, re-set direction, seed practices.  
- **First Quarter (Week 2): Action.** Test, push, commit effort, refine by friction.  
- **Full (Week 3): Witnessing.** Observe results, receive feedback, note clarity.  
- **Last Quarter (Week 4): Integration.** Process experiences, release what doesn’t fit, fold learning back into the field.  

### Key Features
- **Cadence:** 4 weeks → a cycle that is both short enough for momentum, long enough for depth.  
- **Gradients:** boundaries are porous — reflection starts before the quarter, action echoes into fullness.  
- **Mapping:**  
  - *RBWS* — daily wellness practices scaffolded by moon cycle.  
  - *RBFF* — cycle-based review of coherence ledger (money, time, energy).  
  - *Myth Embodied* — *[Placeholder: expand once this project is detailed — this will illustrate how archetypal tones and mythic embodiment track to the lunar cycle.]*  

### Roles
- **Practitioner:** sets intention and practices.  
- **Witness:** notices patterns, logs shifts.  
- **Field Steward:** ensures space/environment supports the cycle.  

### Artifacts
- Intention notes (week 1)  
- Action logs (week 2)  
- Observation harvest (week 3)  
- Integration reflection (week 4)  

### Signals
- Energy & mood shifts  
- Practice consistency  
- Coherence between intention and outcome  
- Ease of transition into next cycle

- [Manifested Works](/manifested-works) — applied systems paced by moon rhythm  
- [Phases](/phases#integration) — five-phase resonance arc  
- [Roadmap](/roadmap) — now/near/mid/long horizons can overlay moon cadence

## Closing
Moon-cycle resonance is not superstition.  
It is a **practical ideology of timing**: a way to align living, working, and creating with a rhythm larger than ourselves.  

By syncing with the moon, we **slow down to integrate**, **speed up in flow**, and allow life to **evolve naturally, in tune with the field**.
