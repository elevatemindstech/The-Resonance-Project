> **As of • Last Quarter (Integration)**  
> This hub showcases current works. It’s not a live log; it’s a clear snapshot of what’s active and how pieces relate.

## Universal Backbone  {#backbone}
- **RES — Resonance Expansion System**  
  A universal mapping + movement system: **Nano → Micro → Meso → Macro → Cosmic** and **Ignition → Exploration → Structuring → Integration → Harmonic Scaling**, with Gates, Unified Dimensions, and care/commons.  
  → See: [RES](/res)

**RES Variants (forthcoming):**
- **RES for Business** — strategy/ops/finance/governance via Nano→Cosmic + phases.  
- **IRIS System** (with **RES AI Guidebook**) — distilled RES for AI context engineering and resonance-based agent development.

## Resonance-Based Culture (domain)  {#culture}
Works that shape shared meaning, language, and mythic tone.

- **Resonance-Based Philosophy (RBP)** — the ten guiding principles. → /philosophy  
- **Language → Reality** — practical ideology for field-shaping through precise, care-based language (pattern cards). → /language-reality  
- **Myth Embodied** *(in development)* — archetypal tone carried through music/movement/making—myth lived, not performed. → /myth-embodied  
- **Resonance-Based Psychology (RBΨ)** *(placeholder)* — parts-aware, somatically grounded practice inspired by IFS + Somatic Experiencing (non-clinical; clear referral boundaries). → /rb-psychology

---

## Resonance-Based Lifestyle (domain)  {#lifestyle}
Lived rhythms that stabilize capacity, clarity, and ease.

- **RBWS — Resonance-Based Wellness System** — fascia as medium; breath/fluids; rhythm as design; pattern library. → /rbws  
- **Moon-Cycle Resonance** — ideology of four-phase cadence (New / First / Full / Last) as optional scaffold; *no live tracking on site*. → /moon-cycle-resonance
