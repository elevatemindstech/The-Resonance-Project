> RES is both **framework** and **work**. It offers a universal 5-point scale (Nano→Cosmic) and a five-phase arc so ideas can grow without distorting their purpose.

## What RES Is  {#overview}
The **Resonance Expansion System (RES)** is a **universal mapping + movement system** used to design, build, and evolve anything—from personal practice to organizations, products, communities, and AI agents.

- **5-Point Mapping (universal lens):** **Nano → Micro → Meso → Macro → Cosmic**  
  Place any effort on one scale to check fit, timing, and transfer.
- **Five Phases (movement):** **Ignition → Exploration → Structuring → Integration → Harmonic Scaling**  
  A humane arc with clear gates and learning loops.
- **Two Flows:** **Idea→Field** (start from intent) and **Field→Idea** (start from signals).  
- **Clarity Lenses:** **Unified Dimensions (8-lens map)** + **Resonance Signals & Metrics**.  
- **Care:** lightweight **roles**, **cadence**, **ethics/access**, and **commons** stance.

**Why it matters:** A single grammar for **coherence across change**.

## Universal 5-Point Mapping  {#universal-5-point-mapping}
Use this lens anywhere—creative, technical, operational, communal, financial, or AI systems.

- **Nano** — seconds/minutes; a micro-gesture, prompt, safeguard, or decision  
- **Micro** — days/weeks; a working session, probe series, or small pilot  
- **Meso** — month/quarter; a v0 release, cohort, or playbook  
- **Macro** — season/year; a program, partnership lane, or product line  
- **Cosmic** — multi-year; an ecosystem practice or commons library

**Checks:**  
- “What’s one scale **smaller**?” → safe next step.  
- “What’s one scale **larger**?” → pattern integrity (does it still hold?).  

**Tripwires:** jumping scales without integration; role collapse; skipped ethics/access; reciprocity erosion.

---

## Two Complementary Flows  {#flows}
- **Idea→Field** — when intent is clear and needs embodiment.  
  Seed intent → Unified Dimensions → probes → design → integrate → scale.  
- **Field→Idea** — when the field is speaking (signals/constraints).  
  Listen & name hypotheses → Unified Dimensions → probes → converge to gates.

Switch flows if signals demand it. Both converge at **Gates**.

---

## The Five Phases (with Gate cues)  {#five-phases}
Each phase ends in a **Gate**—a tiny checklist that unlocks the next step. Phases loop by design.

1. **Ignition** — alignment & intent  
   *Gate asks:* Is intent clear? constraints named? earliest success sketched?

2. **Exploration** — sensing & testing  
   *Gate asks:* UD map done? 3 leverage points named? smallest next step time-boxed?

3. **Structuring** — make it real, safely  
   *Gate asks:* prototype/SOP v0? roles & cadence set? ethics/access passed? pilot MOU drafted?

4. **Integration** — synthesis & adjustment  
   *Gate asks:* what transferred? what to release? pattern excerpt + metrics snapshot captured?

5. **Harmonic Scaling** — growth without drift  
   *Gate asks:* scaling criteria met? partner fit? stewardship/maintenance plan? license/commons stance set?

## Unified Dimensions (8-lens clarity)  {#unified-dimensions}
A compact, isomorphic map that travels across domains:

- **Why** (intent, purpose) • **What** (problem, value) • **How** (methods, governance)  
- **Who** (roles, stakeholders) • **Opportunities** (leverage, hypotheses)  
- **Interconnections** (systems, partners) • **Where** (contexts, constraints) • **When** (timing, cadence)

**Outputs:** a **1-page map**, **3 leverage points**, and **1 smallest next step** (owner + timebox).

---

## Signals & Metrics (resonance-first)  {#metrics}
Measure **coherence**, not just speed or volume.

- **Leading:** clarity reports, consent strength, decision latency, friction notes  
- **Lagging:** cycle time to gate, redo/defect rate, adoption, capacity load  
- **Field:** where emergence is strong/weak; small moves that shift the whole

---

## Anti-Patterns (what we refuse)  {#anti-patterns}
- **Velocity worship** over clarity/consent  
- **Protocol fixation** (no listening to field signals)  
- **Governance theater** (roles named, power unclear)  
- **Extraction** masked as “pilot” (no reciprocity or access)  
- **Resonance drift** (purpose distorted by scale pressure)

---

## Ethics, Inclusion, Commons  {#ethics}
Care at every gate (access, consent, harm checks).  
Patterns return to the **commons** with attribution; pilots compensate contributors fairly.  
Default to a license that protects integrity and encourages reuse.

---

## Variants & Forthcoming Works  {#variants}
- **RES for Business** *(forthcoming)*  
  Strategy, ops, finance, and governance via Nano→Cosmic + Five Phases.  
  Highlights: portfolio across scale; pilot economics; partner lanes; stewardship cycles.

- **IRIS System** *(forthcoming)*  
  A meta-layer integrating RES with AI agents and memory.  
  Includes the **RES AI Guidebook**: distilled RES for **AI context engineering & resonance-based agent development** (gating, role clarity, pattern libraries, safety/consent, multi-scale prompts).

> These will appear as separate pages in Manifested Works when ready.

## Example Lens — Community-Oriented Mapping (illustrative)  {#example-community}
A value-based example to show the **universality** of the 5-point scale. Substitute any domain (product, finance, research, AI agents) and the mapping still holds.

- **Nano** — 3-minute **opening ritual** for meetings (arrive, breathe, one signal).  
- **Micro** — weekly **field circle** (≤45m) to sense friction, name leverage points.  
- **Meso** — monthly **practice cohort** (v0) with consent/access rubric and pattern harvest.  
- **Macro** — seasonal **commons program** (e.g., care cohorts, co-learning series) with partner lanes.  
- **Cosmic** — multi-year **community standards** (ethics, access, reciprocity) and a maintained **commons library** (patterns, playbooks, licenses).

Same grammar, different content. The scale lets the **pattern stay coherent** as it grows.
