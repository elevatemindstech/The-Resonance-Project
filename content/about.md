# About the Resonance Project

The Resonance Project is a way to **sense, decide, and build** so growth doesn’t distort purpose.  
We combine a **precise philosophical stance**, a **universal backbone framework**, and **applied works** that bring coherence into everyday life and collaboration.

## Philosophy (why/how we move)

**Resonance-Based Philosophy** names the stance behind everything here—ten principles that balance depth with accessibility and keep systems humane as they scale.  
It’s the throughline connecting wellness, finance, language, creative work, and organizational design.  
→ Read: **[Resonance-Based Philosophy](philosophy.md)**

## Manifested Works (what this looks like)

Our works are **applied expressions** of the philosophy and frameworks:

- **RES — Resonance Expansion System** (universal backbone): a Nano→Cosmic 5-point map and a five-phase movement with gates and care.  
- **RBWS — Resonance-Based Wellness System** (embodied coherence).  
- **RBFF — Resonance-Based Financial Framework** (coherence ledgers & reciprocity).  
- **Language → Reality** (field-shaping through precise, care-based language).  
- **Myth Embodied** (in development).

## How it moves

- **Five Phases (with Gates):** *Ignition → Exploration → Structuring → Integration → Harmonic Scaling*.  
- **Two Flows:** **Idea→Field** (start from intent) and **Field→Idea** (start from signals).  
- **Shared Lenses:** **Unified Dimensions** (8-lens clarity), **Nano→Cosmic** scaling, **Resonance Metrics**.

## Domains (how people enter)

- **Resonance-Based Culture** — Philosophy, Language→Reality, Myth Embodied, and a parts-aware **Resonance-Based Psychology** (placeholder).  
- **Resonance-Based Lifestyle** — RBWS and Moon-Cycle Resonance (ideology only; no live tracking).

## Status & Cadence

This site is **living**. Pages may be marked draft, in-review, or stable. We iterate with care, aligning **integration** to a moon-cycle rhythm at the level of orientation (not as a live journal).
