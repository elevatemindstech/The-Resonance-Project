# Harmonic Scaling

Harmonic Scaling (aka Nano‑to‑Cosmic Scaling) is a coherence lens and playbook for expanding practices, pilots, and programs without value drift. It focuses on preserving consent, feedback density, and energy economics as scope grows—so scale amplifies aligned outcomes instead of fragmenting them.

Use this page when you have repeatable patterns or validated pilots and are preparing to grow, partner, or systematize.

## Guiding principles

- **Scale clarity, not complexity** — codify intent and non‑negotiables; simplify at scale.  
- **Preserve feedback density** — maintain rapid learning mechanisms as participation increases.  
- **Fractal design** — replicate small coherent units with local autonomy and shared principles.  
- **Protocol over prescription** — set minimum viable standards; allow adaptation at the edges.  
- **Consent & care by default** — preserve opt‑in, reversibility, and accessibility across scale.  
- **Energy economics** — ensure contributor capacity matches amplified expectations.

## Five scale bands

1. **Nano** — Individual micro‑practices and personal decisions (minutes → days).  
2. **Micro** — Team rituals, sprint cadences, small cohorts (weeks → months).  
3. **Meso** — Program structures, community norms, local partnerships (months → year).  
4. **Macro** — Organizational protocols, cross‑network alignment, funded programs (1+ year).  
5. **Cosmic** — Field conventions, standards, policy touchpoints, ecosystem norms (multi‑year).

Each band requires different artifacts, governance, and coherence checks. Growth should move through bands iteratively, not skip levels.

## Patterns & tactics

- **Fractal Units**  
  Define a small, repeatable unit (e.g., 20‑minute resonance standup) and a lightweight spec so local nodes can implement autonomously.

- **Protocols (minimum viable standards)**  
  Document non‑negotiables (consent language, data handling rules, accessibility baseline) and share them as a protocol document.

- **Partner Resonance Agreement**  
  Before onboarding partners, run a partner resonance check (values, pace, access, decision norms).

- **Guardrails and Flexibility**  
  Provide boundary conditions rather than prescriptive steps. Example: require captions and opt‑out options, but let local hosts choose scheduling.

- **Bundled Tooling & Templates**  
  Distribute templates (consent text, feedback instruments, facilitator one‑pager) to reduce cognitive load and preserve quality.

- **Capacity‑aware Commitments**  
  Align commitments to resourcing. Avoid volunteer‑only scaling promises that increase hidden labor.

## Coherence checks (before and during scaling)

Use these checkpoints when considering expansion:

- **Purpose alignment (Why):** Is each new instance aligned to the resonance statement?  
- **Outcome clarity (What):** Are success criteria explicit and measurable per band?  
- **Governance (How):** Is decision ownership and escalation clear across partners?  
- **Access (Who/Where):** Are access needs and local contexts honored? Is translation/localization planned?  
- **Feedback density:** Are resonance signals and feedback loops preserved (weekly, monthly, quarterly)?  
- **Energy economics:** Are staffing and compensation matched to increased scope?  
- **Risk & boundary metrics:** Are safety, privacy, and opt‑out mechanisms preserved?

If any check is amber/red, pause and remediate before expanding further.

## Partner criteria (template)

Copy the checklist below into partner intake or an issue template.

~~~yaml
partner_name: ""
aligned_values: true   # yes/no
pace_fit: "slow | medium | fast"
access_commitments:
  captions: true
  localization: false
  low_bandwidth_mode: true
data_practices_compatible: true
decision_protocols_known: true
resource_commitment: "volunteer | funded | partially-funded"
risk_mitigations: []
notes: ""
governance_contact: ""
~~~

Minimum acceptance: `aligned_values && data_practices_compatible && resource_commitment != "volunteer"` (unless clearly funded alternatives exist).

## Scaling playbook (practical checklist)

1. Validate repeatability: run 3 pilots in micro contexts with similar signals.  
2. Create an Implementation Spec: one‑page spec for the fractal unit (goals, timing, consent, artifacts).  
3. Codify Protocols: consent language, data rules, accessibility baseline, escalation path.  
4. Partner resonance check: run intake conversation + checklist.  
5. Local adaptation plan: allow 1–2 local changes; require documentation of adaptations.  
6. Feedback system: maintain weekly signal checks + monthly synthesis + quarterly pattern review.  
7. Resource map: confirm staffing, funding, and tooling per partner.  
8. Coherence gate: hold a go/no‑go review using the coherence checklist.  
9. Pilot scale: roll out to limited partner set (3–5 local nodes).  
10. Evaluate: synthesize learnings; adjust protocols; expand or pause.

## Metrics for scaling (3‑3‑2 applied to scale)

- **Signals (qualitative):** local felt ease, local stories of value, partner-initiated improvements.  
- **Proxies (quantitative):** retention/completion per node, time‑to‑decision for local issues, # of documented adaptations.  
- **Boundary (do‑no‑harm):** opt‑out rate, incident count & resolution time.

Track at node level and aggregated across nodes. Use narrative alongside numbers to prevent metric distortion.

---

## Partner onboarding & playbook (template outline)

- **Intro packet:** resonance statement, one‑page spec, consent & data rules, facilitator one‑pager.  
- **Onboarding call:** values/pacing alignment; access needs; resource confirmation.  
- **Dry run:** local host runs a dry run with pilot participants.  
- **Local launch:** track 4‑week micro‑pilot and report using Pilot Playbook synthesis.  
- **Scale decision:** apply coherence gate; document deviations and approvals.

---

## Example: Fractal Learning Series (compact)

- **Nano:** 20‑minute weekly micro‑practice for individuals.  
- **Micro:** cohort of 12 runs 4‑week pilot using Pilot Playbook.  
- **Meso:** 10 cohorts across 3 cities adopt standard spec, with local adaptations captured.  
- **Macro:** network publishes a scaling guide and partner criteria.  
- **Cosmic:** field conventions emerge—shared protocols adopted by libraries and civic tech networks.

Key success: each scale step preserved consent, feedback density, and compensated facilitation.

---

## Anti‑patterns (avoid these)

- Big‑bang scaling without pilot validation.  
- Hidden governance: unclear who decides or escalates problems.  
- Metrics-only decisions: scaling because numbers look good but narratives show drift.  
- Volunteer exhaustion: assuming unfunded scale will be sustained by goodwill.  
- One-size-fits-all mandates that ignore local context.

## Next steps (practical)

- If you have a validated pilot, prepare an Implementation Spec and run the partner resonance checklist for 1–3 prospective nodes.  
- Keep expansions reversible and timeboxed; prefer staged pilots over immediate broad rollouts.
