# Unified Dimensions Framework

A clear, humane way to explore any idea, project, or system across eight interconnected lenses. Use it to uncover gaps, illuminate connections, and choose the smallest next step that preserves coherence.

## What It Does

- Aligns intent (Why) with outcomes (What) and practice (How)
- Surfaces gaps, dependencies, and leverage points
- Creates shared language for collaboration
- Keeps work resonant as it grows across contexts and scales

## When To Use

- Early exploration of a new idea or field
- Before designing prototypes or plans
- Prior to scaling or partnering (coherence check)
- During retrospectives to diagnose drift or friction

## The Eight Dimensions (prompts)

### Why — Intent and values
- What purpose is alive here? What shift do we aim to harmonize with (personal, collective, planetary)?
- Whose needs and values are centered—and whose might be missing?

### What — Outcomes and structures
- What becomes real (artifacts, services, behaviors)? What will we not do (boundaries)?
- What constraints and trade-offs are explicit? What does “good” look like at different scales?

### How — Methods and governance
- What practices, protocols, and decision processes guide action?
- What feedback loops, ethics, and consent practices keep us honest?

### Who — Roles and relationships
- Who is impacted, invited, and accountable? What capacities are present or needed?
- How do we meet people where they are (access, pace, readiness)?

### Opportunities — Leverage and innovation
- Where can small moves make meaningful shifts?
- What hypotheses feel testable within a 2–4 week timebox?

### Interconnections — Systems and partnerships
- What projects, standards, or communities can we link with instead of duplicating?
- What dependencies or shared infrastructure could accelerate us?

### Where — Contexts and environments
- Which geographies, platforms, or communities are most aligned?
- What environmental or cultural conditions shape feasibility?

### When — Timing and cadence
- What signals indicate readiness? What needs to happen first?
- What is the smallest next step now—and who will own it?

## Lightweight Mapping Method (60–90 minutes)

1) Prep (5–10 min)
- Place the resonance statement at the top; set a humane scope (one idea/system).
- Name the decision you want this map to inform.

2) Diverge (15–25 min)
- Brainstorm per dimension on separate notes; no editing or debating.

3) Converge (20–25 min)
- Cluster themes; mark dependencies, risks, and assumptions.
- Highlight contradictions (e.g., strong Why, vague What).

4) Align (10–15 min)
- Choose 3 leverage points; define 1 smallest next step with an owner and timebox.

5) Decide & Document (5–10 min)
- Capture the snapshot, decisions, and open questions.
- Link the map to your [Roadmap](./roadmap.md) and any [Pilots](./pilot-playbook.md).

Tip: Keep it light. You can remap in 30 minutes as the field changes.

## Outputs

- One-page map (photo, PDF, or note) linked in your repo
- Three leverage points with rationale
- One smallest next step (owner, timebox)
- Risks/assumptions list and key interconnections
- Links to related notes, pilots, or partners

## Example (compact)

- Why: Cultivate humane scaling for a community learning series; protect energy and consent.
- What: Pilot playbook, consent template, weekly resonance review; no big-bang launch.
- How: Timeboxed 4-week pilot; advice process for design; consent-based policy updates.
- Who: Stewards, participants, accessibility reviewer; partner librarian.
- Opportunities: Reuse open-source facilitation guides; co-host with local mutual-aid group.
- Interconnections: Civic tech network; public library rooms; shared calendar infrastructure.
- Where: Hybrid—online coordination; in-person sessions at the library.
- When: Start next month; mid-pilot coherence check in week 2; synthesis in week 4.

Decision: Run a 4-week pilot with 12 participants; steward: Maya; start date: Sep 10.

## Patterns to Watch (with remedies)

- Why–What mismatch
  - Symptom: Inspiring purpose, fuzzy deliverables.
  - Remedy: Define one clear success criterion per deliverable.

- What–How mismatch
  - Symptom: Detailed plan, unclear roles/governance.
  - Remedy: Name a decision owner; choose advice vs. consent; set a cadence.

- Why–How tension
  - Symptom: Strong values, misaligned practices.
  - Remedy: Add a lightweight resonance check at decision points.

- Who–Where gap
  - Symptom: Intended audience doesn’t match the context or channel.
  - Remedy: Shift venue or format; invite co-design from the affected group.

## Anti‑patterns

- Skipping governance and ethics (the “How”) until late-stage scaling
- Over‑specifying artifacts while ignoring constraints and capacity
- Mapping once, then treating it as static truth
- Treating interconnections as marketing rather than structural collaboration
