# FAQ — Resonance Project

This FAQ collects common practical questions and concise answers to help you act with clarity and care. If your question isn't answered here, please open an issue or contact a Steward (see Engagement & Collaboration).

---

## General

Q: What is the Resonance Project?  
A: A living framework and practice library for aligning purpose, practice, and scale using resonance principles. It provides frameworks, templates, and playbooks to design humane, iterative change.

Q: Where do I start?  
A: Read "Start Here" (index.md), the "About" page, and the "Core Frameworks" overview. Then map your context with the Unified Dimensions and consider a 2–4 week pilot using the Pilot Playbook.

Q: What is a resonance statement and where do I write one?  
A: A short articulation of intent and non‑negotiable values for your initiative. Put it at the top of any Unified Dimensions map, Pilot brief, or Roadmap item.

---

## Documentation & Navigation

Q: Where are the core documents?  
A: Core pages include Start Here, About, Core Frameworks, Unified Dimensions, Pilot Playbook, Harmonic Scaling, Engagement & Collaboration, Roadmap, Glossary, and the Glossary. Use the site nav or the Roadmap to locate the canonical versions.

Q: How do I know if a page is stable?  
A: Pages are marked draft / in‑review / stable in the YAML front matter and the header. Check the updated date and version notes in the page footer or the changelog.

Q: How do I request an update to a page?  
A: Open an issue in the repository providing the page link, a short UD (Unified Dimensions) map if relevant, and a proposed change. Follow the contribution flow in Engagement & Collaboration.

---

## Pilots & Experiments

Q: When should I run a pilot?  
A: Run a pilot when you have a testable hypothesis that needs real‑world signals before committing more resources—typically 2–4 weeks, small participant count, reversible.

Q: How do I design a pilot?  
A: Use the Pilot Playbook YAML brief template: define purpose, hypothesis, beneficiaries, scope, consent, inclusion, 3‑3‑2 metrics, risks, schedule, and decision gate.

Q: What are the minimum ethical requirements before launch?  
A: Plain‑language consent, data minimization, opt‑out path, Ethics/Access reviewer signoff, and accommodations for inclusion. Pilots touching sensitive topics require extra review.

Q: How should I publish pilot results?  
A: Use the Pilot Synthesis template. Publish an anonymized synthesis in the Pilot Library and link it from your Roadmap item and UD map.

---

## Contribution & Collaboration

Q: How do I contribute content or code?  
A: Read CONTRIBUTING.md, open an issue describing your change with a UD map if applicable, draft a branch/PR, request review from a Steward and an Ethics/Access reviewer for anything affecting participation, then merge per the advice/consent rules.

Q: What licenses apply?  
A: Content defaults to CC BY 4.0. Templates and code default to MIT or Apache‑2.0. State license headers in submitted files.

Q: How are decisions made?  
A: Default protocol is the advice process (owner solicits advice, then decides). Consent‑based decisions are used for shared policies. Use RACI for operational clarity where needed.

Q: Who are Stewards and how are they appointed?  
A: Stewards hold domain coherence (e.g., frameworks, pilots, metrics). Appointment follows the Steward registry process—propose, consult affected parties, and record consent.

---

## Inclusion, Access & Ethics

Q: How does the project ensure accessibility?  
A: Inclusion & Access is a core framework. Templates and events default to captions, transcripts, plain language, low bandwidth alternatives, and trauma‑informed options. Budget for accessibility in partner agreements.

Q: How is consent handled?  
A: All pilots and public activities include plain‑language consent that explains purpose, time, risks, data use, and opt‑out. Use the consent snippet in the Pilot Playbook.

Q: How are harms or conflicts addressed?  
A: Start with immediate safety and withdrawal, then mediation via Steward or Ethics/Access reviewer. Formal reports trigger documented processes, restorative options, and, if necessary, corrective actions. Privacy and minimizing retraumatization are priorities.

---

## Metrics & Monitoring

Q: What is the 3‑3‑2 pattern?  
A: Use 3 qualitative signals, 3 quantitative proxies, and 2 boundary (do‑no‑harm) metrics for lightweight, meaningful dashboards.

Q: How often should metrics be reviewed?  
A: Weekly signal checks, monthly syntheses, and quarterly pattern reviews. Roadmap items report fortnightly to their issues while active.

Q: Are numbers the primary decision driver?  
A: No. Numbers inform but are paired with narratives; metrics are mirrors, not masters.

---

## Scaling & Partnerships

Q: How do we know when to scale?  
A: Through Harmonic Scaling coherence checks: purpose alignment, governance clarity, preserved feedback density, energy economics (resourcing), and boundary metrics. Any amber/red requires remediation.

Q: What must partners agree to?  
A: Partners complete a partner resonance check (values, pace, access), accept data and consent protocols, and confirm resource commitments. Use the Partner Intake YAML as the intake form.

Q: Can local nodes adapt the spec?  
A: Yes—allow 1–2 documented local adaptations per Implementation Spec, provided non‑negotiables (consent, safety, data rules) are preserved and adaptations are recorded.

---

## Roadmap & Governance

Q: How are roadmap items proposed and prioritized?  
A: Use the Roadmap YAML item template in an issue. Stewards and Ethics/Access reviewers triage proposals. Prioritization follows safety first, lean experiments, and capacity‑aware planning.

Q: What gates exist for major changes?  
A: Gates include ethics/access review, coherence gate (Harmonic Scaling), and consent from affected stewards for policy or norm changes.

Q: Where are decisions recorded?  
A: In the Decision Log (linked from Engagement & Collaboration). Each entry should contain date, owner, rationale, affected pages, and next steps.

---

## Privacy & Data

Q: What data practices are required?  
A: Minimize collection, define retention and deletion, use role‑based access, and anonymize published material by default. Follow the data rules in Pilot Playbook and Protocols.

Q: Who can access raw pilot data?  
A: Access is role‑based; only those listed in the pilot brief with a necessity should have raw access. Ethics/Access reviewers may audit.

---

## Troubleshooting & Support

Q: I found an error or outdated doc — what do I do?  
A: Open a content issue with the page link, suggested fix, and affected users. If urgent (privacy/safety), flag as high priority and notify a Steward.

Q: I need an accommodation or compensation for participation — who do I contact?  
A: Use the contact_for_access field in the pilot brief or reach the Project Steward. Partner agreements should include compensation terms; request escalation if missing.

Q: Who do I contact for legal questions or formal partnerships?  
A: Contact the Partnerships Steward or the listed governance contact; for formal contracts consult legal counsel before commitments.

---

## Contact & Communication

Q: Where can I ask other questions?  
A: Open an issue or join the public discussion channels listed on the Start Here page. For stewarded domains, contact the named Steward in Engagement & Collaboration.

Q: How do I get notified about updates?  
A: Subscribe to the repo or the project's announcement channel. Roadmap releases and major doc updates are published quarterly.

---

## Contributing to the FAQ

Q: Can I add a question?  
A: Yes. Open an issue with the proposed Q&A and supporting references or PR the change. Include the UD map if the change affects scope or governance.

## Final notes

- This FAQ is a living document—expect updates as practices evolve.  
- When in doubt: prioritize small, reversible steps that preserve consent, feedback density, and the resonance statement.
