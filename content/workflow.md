# Idea-to-Field Expansion Workflow

A clear, humane path for turning inspiration into aligned action. The workflow is cyclical—each phase can loop back based on feedback, preserving coherence as you grow.

## Overview

- Five phases: Ignition → Exploration → Structuring → Integration → Harmonic Scaling
- Nature: Iterative, with feedback loops between adjacent phases
- Aim: Keep Why–What–How aligned while moving from concept to practice to scale

## Phases and Gates

### 1. Ignition (Resonance)
- Inputs: initial idea, hunches, values
- Activities: clarify purpose; craft a resonance statement; name motivations and boundaries
- Outputs: resonance statement; “done-for-now” scope; smallest next step
- Gate: team shares a clear “done for now” and agrees on the next step

### 2. Exploration (Landscape Mapping)
- Inputs: resonance statement; questions; early constraints
- Activities: map Why/What/How (+ Who, Opportunities, Interconnections, Where, When); scan field; surface risks
- Outputs: context map; 3 actionable insights; initial collaborator list
- Gate: at least 3 insights and 1 smallest next step are named

### 3. Structuring (Design and Planning)
- Inputs: insights; constraints; potential partners
- Activities: design prototypes and workflows; define roles; set minimal success criteria
- Outputs: prototype briefs; ethics/consent approach; action plan
- Gate: each prototype has owner, timebox, and success criteria

### 4. Integration (Pilots and Learning)
- Inputs: prototype briefs; consent and access plans
- Activities: run pilots; collect signals and metrics; host resonance reviews
- Outputs: pilot report; learning log; keep/change/stop decisions
- Gate: explicit refine-or-scale decision with rationale

### 5. Harmonic Scaling (Sustainable Growth)
- Inputs: proven patterns; partner interest; risk assessment
- Activities: codify protocols; align partners; monitor coherence and energy economics
- Outputs: scaling guide; partner criteria; coherence checklist
- Gate: value-drift check passed; feedback density preserved; risks mitigated

## Core Artifacts

- Resonance statement
- Unified Dimensions map
- Prototype briefs (with success criteria)
- Consent and access checklist
- Pilot report and learning log
- Scaling guide and partner criteria

## Roles (lightweight)

- Decision Owner: accountable for scope and gates
- Facilitator: holds process and cadence
- Ethics/Access Reviewer: ensures care and inclusion
- Documenter/Editor: captures artifacts and learnings
- Partner Liaison: manages alignment with collaborators

## Cadence (example)

- Weekly resonance standup (45 min): signals, friction, decision, next step
- Biweekly design review: adjust prototypes and success criteria
- Monthly synthesis: publish learnings; update roadmap
