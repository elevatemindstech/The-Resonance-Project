# Inclusion & Access

This page centralizes the project's defaults, minimum standards, and practical tools for designing inclusive, accessible, and trauma‑informed engagements — whether you're authoring a doc, running a pilot, hosting a call, or onboarding partners. Inclusion and access are not optional add‑ons; they are structural requirements for resonance work.

## Purpose

- Make participation reachable for people across sensory, cognitive, social, cultural, economic, and geographic differences.  
- Protect participant agency, dignity, and safety using trauma‑informed practices.  
- Ensure accessibility is planned, budgeted, and reviewed — not tacked on at the last minute.

---

## Guiding principles

- Accessibility by default — design first for the most constrained contexts (low bandwidth, screen readers, non-native speakers).  
- Consent and sovereignty — participants should know purpose, data use, and opt-out paths; they keep agency.  
- Minimal cognitive load — reduce jargon, use plain language, and provide TL;DRs.  
- Multiple modes of participation — synchronous and asynchronous, audio/text/video, active/observational.  
- Compensate labor — budget for facilitation, captioning, translation, and community labor.  
- Continuous improvement — audit, learn, and adapt from participant feedback.

---

## Minimum standards (project defaults)

Apply these standards to every public activity and pilot by default.

- Plain‑language summary at top of every page or invitation (1–3 sentences).  
- Consent snippet included in every pilot/event description.  
- Captions and transcripts for all audio/video; live captioning for public sessions when possible.  
- Alt text for every image and descriptive labels for diagrams.  
- Accessible documents (semantic headings, readable fonts, sufficient contrast, screen‑reader friendly).  
- Low‑bandwidth alternatives (text only, audio‑only, or downloadable packets).  
- Multiple participation channels (chat + voice + asynchronous doc).  
- Clear accommodation request path and contact.  
- Ethics/Access review for participant‑facing workflows and pilots (signoff before launch).

---

## Trauma‑informed facilitation defaults

Use these practices for facilitation and design to reduce harm and respect autonomy.

- Opt‑in frames: invite rather than require participation in sensitive exercises.  
- Camera‑optional policy: never mandate cameras; provide alternatives.  
- Trigger‑aware language: avoid graphic prompts; provide content warnings where needed.  
- Breaks & pacing: timebox sessions and schedule predictable breaks.  
- Quiet modes: allow non‑verbal contributions (chat, written reflections, private notes).  
- Reset and exit options: clear instructions for leaving a session and accessing support.  
- Post‑session debrief: provide synthesis and resources, and invite feedback privately.

---

## Consent & data practices

Consent must be clear, accessible, and reversible.

- Provide plain‑language consent that states: purpose, activities, time commitment, data collected, retention, sharing, and opt‑out method. Use the Pilot Playbook consent snippet as baseline.  
- Data minimization: collect only required information. Avoid sensitive personal data unless justified and explicitly consented.  
- Role‑based access: raw identifiable data limited to named roles in the pilot brief (steward, documenter, ethics reviewer).  
- Retention & deletion: state retention period; delete personal data on schedule.  
- Publication: anonymize quotes unless explicit permission is obtained; document provenance for any attributed material.  
- Incident handling: make a safe reporting path visible in all participant materials.

Copyable consent snippet (use & adapt):

~~~text
Purpose: [one sentence].
What you'll do: [bullets].
Time: [X minutes / sessions].
Data: [what will be collected, storage, retention].
Publication: "Anonymized syntheses by default; quotes only with permission."
Participation is voluntary. You may opt out at any time by contacting [contact].
Questions or accommodations: [contact_for_access].
I consent to participate: Yes / No   Name (optional): ____   Date: ____
~~~

---

## Accommodations catalog (examples & how to offer them)

Offer a clear menu of accommodations and the contact/response SLA.

Common accommodations:
- Live captioning / real‑time captions (CART)  
- Post‑session transcripts and summaries  
- ASL interpretation or local sign language support where relevant  
- Translation / localization of materials (summaries + key docs)  
- Low‑bandwidth participation mode (telephone dial‑in, email threads, text packets)  
- Screen‑reader‑friendly documents (semantic structure, alt text)  
- Extended time options or asynchronous response channels  
- Quiet/low‑stimulus rooms and camera‑off participation  
- Honoraria or stipends for community/human labor

Accommodation request flow (recommended)
1. Request (via form or contact email) — include desired accommodation and any preferred timeline.  
2. Acknowledge within 48–72 hours and confirm possible adjustments.  
3. Deliver accommodation or provide an alternative timeline/solution.  
4. Log the accommodation (for learning, not for public exposure), respecting privacy.

Sample accommodation request form (YAML):

~~~yaml
request_id: ""
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
name: ""                  # optional
contact: ""
event_or_pilot: ""
requested_accommodation: ""
preferred_timing: ""
additional_notes: ""
response_by: "YYYY-MM-DD"
assigned_responder: ""
status: "requested|in-progress|fulfilled|declined"

## Document & event accessibility checklist

Use this checklist before publishing any document or running any session.

Document checklist
- Plain‑language summary present.  
- Semantic headings and logical reading order.  
- Alt text for images and descriptive captions for diagrams.  
- Keyboard‑accessible links and controls.  
- Contrast ratio meets WCAG AA minimums.  
- Downloadable text‑only or audio alternative available.  
- File names descriptive; metadata included.  
- Proofread for inclusive language and jargon.

Event checklist
- Plain invitation and consent snippet visible on registration page.  
- Captioning/transcription arranged (live or immediate).  
- Accommodation contact and SLA included.  
- Agenda with clear expectations and timing.  
- Facilitator one‑pager including trauma‑informed cues and escalation path.  
- Dry‑run for technology and accessibility checks.  
- Post‑session transcript, TL;DR, and anonymized synthesis promised and delivered.

---

## Tools, formats & how to prioritize

Preferred formats & tools (decision based on team capacity and audience)
- Text + Markdown (low‑bandwidth, screen‑reader friendly).  
- Audio (MP3) for summaries. Provide transcripts.  
- SRT/VTT files for captions.  
- Accessible PDFs (tagged) when necessary.  
- Video with captions and short chapter markers.  
- Simple forms (Google Form, Typeform, static form endpoints) for accommodation requests.

Prioritization rule: Always ship a plain‑language text summary and an accommodation contact. Add captions/transcripts on schedule if live captioning is beyond budget for a specific session — communicate the timeline up front.

---

## Budgeting for access

Accessibility costs money and time. Include line items in partner/resource maps:

Suggested budget items
- Live captioning / CART (per hour)  
- Transcription (per minute)  
- Translation/localization (per word or per doc bundle)  
- ASL/interpreter fees (per hour)  
- Honoraria for community contributors or lived‑experience reviewers  
- Compensation for facilitation and documentation time

Resource map requirement: Any Roadmap item or Partner agreement that expands participation should include a resource map specifying accessibility budgets and who pays.

---

## Ethics/Access reviewer role & signoff

For participant-facing work, require an Ethics/Access reviewer to confirm minimums before launch.

Reviewer responsibilities
- Validate consent language and data practices.  
- Confirm accommodation pathways are in place or a mitigation plan exists.  
- Check that materials meet basic accessibility checks (document checklist).  
- Ensure incident reporting and escalation paths are visible.

Signoff template (YAML):

~~~yaml
item: ""
reviewer: ""
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
consent_language_ok: true|false
data_minimization_ok: true|false
accommodations_planned: true|false
document_accessibility_checks_passed: true|false
notes: ""
approval: "approved|needs_work|rejected"
~~~

## Training & onboarding for stewards and facilitators

Offer short, practical training for people who will run events, review pilots, or steward partnerships.

Suggested modules (30–90 min each)
- Plain language & inclusive writing (30 min)  
- Accessibility basics & quick checks (45 min)  
- Trauma‑informed facilitation (60–90 min)  
- Accommodation triage and logistics (30–45 min)  
- Consent & data basics (30 min)  
- Using inclusive tools (captioning platforms, accessible docs) (45 min)

Keep training recorded with transcripts and provide a short facilitator checklist card.

---

## Evaluation & continuous improvement

- After each pilot/event, include an inclusion/access section in the pilot synthesis: what accommodations were requested, fulfilled, missed, costs, and learnings.  
- Quarterly: run an accessibility audit across active pages and syntheses — sample nodes and participant feedback.  
- Track accommodation SLA metrics (acknowledgment time, fulfillment time) and boundary metrics (opt‑out reasons tied to accessibility).  
- Use learnings to update Implementation Specs, templates, and budget defaults.

Suggested monitoring items
- Accommodation request acknowledgment time (target ≤72h).  
- Accommodation fulfillment rate.  
- Participant-reported accessibility satisfaction (micro‑survey item).  
- Number of missed accommodation commitments and remediations.

## Anti‑patterns (what to avoid)

- Treating accessibility as an optional task at the end of design.  
- Relying solely on volunteers to provide accessibility services without compensation.  
- Collecting personal or sensitive data without a clear, consented reason.  
- Ignoring accommodation requests or responding with delays.  
- Equating "low participation" with "lack of interest" without investigating access barriers.

## Final note

Inclusion and access are ongoing practices, not one-time checkboxes. Build them into briefs, budgets, and steward responsibilities. When in doubt, slow down, ask what would make participation possible for those most affected, and fund the work that makes inclusion real.
