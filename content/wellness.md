# Resonance-Based Wellness System (RBWS)

RBWS maps health as a **resonant flow of energy** across physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual dimensions.

---

## Core Elements
- **Creative Energy as Source** → energy flows through DNA, fascia, and subtle channels.  
- **The Body as Resonance Network** → fascia and meridians connect energy to lived experience.  
- **Scaling Awareness** → resonance is fractal, linking cells, bodies, communities, and ecosystems.  

---

## Frameworks
- **Unified Dimensions Framework** → maps coherence across 4 dimensions (physical, emotional, mental, spiritual).  
- **Five Phases of Resonance Expansion** → Ignition → Exploration → Structuring → Integration → Harmonic Scaling.  
- **Nano-to-Cosmic Scaling** → wellness practices that expand from micro (cellular health) to macro (planetary alignment).

## Practices
- Somatic awareness & fascia release.  
- Breath and voice tuning.  
- Harmonic sequencing of daily practices.  
- Journaling and mythic reflection.

> *Wellness is resonance.  
> To be well is to be attuned: body, mind, heart, and spirit in harmonic flow.*
