# Engagement and Collaboration

This page describes how people and organizations join, contribute to, and make decisions within the Resonance Project. It centers humane participation, clear roles, and lightweight governance so collaboration scales without eroding coherence.

Use this as the operational handbook for partnerships, contributions, decision-making protocols, and community agreements.

---

## Principles

- Start with consent and care: participation is opt‑in, reversible, and accessible.  
- Make accountability explicit: name owners for scopes and gates.  
- Prefer advice by default, consent for shared policy, RACI for operational clarity.  
- Keep contribution friction low: clear pathways, templates, and onboarding.  
- Preserve feedback density and learning: iterate publicly with humility.  
- Respect sovereignty and context: those closest to impact have voice and priority.

## Participation pathways

- Reader / Learner — consume materials, join public sessions, use resources.  
- Practitioner — run pilots, apply frameworks, publish syntheses.  
- Contributor — submit content, templates, or code; follow contribution process.  
- Partner / Host — implement fractal units locally; agree to partner criteria.  
- Steward / Maintainer — hold editorial, governance, or platform responsibilities.

Each pathway has a clear minimal onboarding step and an expected set of commitments (timebox, deliverables, role description).

---

## Roles & responsibilities

- Steward(s): hold coherence for a domain (frameworks, pilot library, metrics).  
- Decision Owner: accountable for a specific scope, prototype, or gate.  
- Facilitator: runs sessions, holds process integrity, supports consent.  
- Ethics/Access Reviewer: ensures inclusion, data care, trauma-informed design.  
- Documenter / Editor: captures artifacts, maintains living docs.  
- Partner Liaison: manages relationships and intake with organizations.

Tip: In small teams, roles may be combined. When scaling, keep at least one named Steward per area.

---

## Decision protocols

- Advice process (default)  
  - Owner solicits written or verbal advice from relevant people; owner decides and records rationale.
- Consent-based decisions (for shared norms or policies)  
  - Require explicit consent from affected stewards/participants before adoption.
- RACI (for complex operational handoffs)  
  - Use RACI to clarify who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed for a deliverable.
- Emergency/fast path  
  - Define a short emergency protocol for safety or legal issues; document and review post-hoc.

Record decisions in the project log (date, owner, contributors, rationale, links to artifacts).

---

## Onboarding & partner intake

1. Partner resonance check  
   - Use the Partner Intake checklist from Harmonic Scaling (aligned values, data practices, resource commitment).  
2. One-page intro packet  
   - Include: resonance statement; Implementation Spec; consent & data rules; facilitator one‑pager.  
3. Onboarding call (30–60 min)  
   - Align values, pace, access needs, and confirm resource model.  
4. Dry run  
   - Local host runs a dry run; Steward observes; adjustments captured.  
5. 4‑week micro‑pilot  
   - Report using the Pilot Playbook synthesis template.  
6. Scale decision  
   - Apply the coherence gate and partner criteria before broader roll‑out.

See: [Harmonic Scaling](./harmonic-scaling.md) • [Pilot Playbook](./pilot-playbook.md)

## Contribution flow (content & code)

- Read the Contribution Guide (README / CONTRIBUTING.md).  
- Open an issue describing the change or idea; link a brief Unified Dimensions map if relevant.  
- Draft in a branch or fork; include tests or acceptance criteria for operational artifacts.  
- Submit PR / merge request. Use the advice process: request review from at least one Steward and one Ethics/Access reviewer for content that affects participation.  
- For significant changes (policy templates, norms), require consent from affected stewards.

Licenses
- Content: default to CC BY 4.0.  
- Templates & code: default to MIT or Apache‑2.0. State license in repo headers.

---

## Community agreements (minimum)

- Be clear and generous in interpretation; assume good intent, verify impact.  
- Use plain language and accessible formats.  
- Honor confidentiality requests and opt‑outs.  
- Surface conflicts early; prefer restorative, curiosity‑based processes.  
- Credit contributions and make authorship visible.

Publish the Community Agreements in a visible place and review annually.

---

## Accessibility, inclusion & care

- Apply Inclusion & Access defaults to all engagements (captions, transcripts, low‑bandwidth options, plain language).  
- Offer trauma‑informed participation modes (quiet rooms, camera‑optional, breaks).  
- Request and honor accommodation needs before events.  
- Budget for accessibility (captioning, translation, compensation) in partner agreements.

See: [Inclusion & Access](./inclusion-and-access.md)

---

## Conflict resolution & harm response

- Low‑level concerns: raise in a resonance review or to the relevant Steward for mediation.  
- Formal concerns: submit a documented report to the Ethics/Access Reviewer and at least one Steward.  
- Harm protocol:  
  1. Prioritize immediate safety/withdrawal options for affected people.  
  2. Offer restorative conversation pathways (facilitated discussion, mediated agreements).  
  3. If necessary, enforce corrective actions (content removal, role suspension) after consented process.  
  4. Document resolutions and follow up on systemic changes.

Maintain privacy and minimize retraumatization; use anonymized summaries for public transparency when appropriate.

---

## Meetings, cadence & workflows

- Weekly resonance standup (45 min): signals, friction, decision, next step.  
- Biweekly design review (60 min): prototyping, templates, pilot support.  
- Monthly synthesis (90 min): publish learnings, update roadmap.  
- Ad‑hoc working sessions: timeboxed, documented, with agendas and note taker.

Keep meeting notes public and searchable; attach decisions and action owners.

---

## Templates & artifacts (copy‑friendly)

- Partner Intake YAML (see Harmonic Scaling).  
- Pilot brief YAML — see [Pilot Playbook](./pilot-playbook.md).  
- Contribution issue template: title, brief UD map link, acceptance criteria, reviewer list.  
- Decision log entry template:

~~~yaml
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
owner: ""
decision_summary: ""
rationale: ""
affected_pages: []
next_steps: []
~~~

---

## Compensation, resourcing & labor

- Be explicit about paid vs volunteer roles in partner and contributor agreements.  
- Prefer funded or partially funded models for scaling commitments.  
- Track hidden labor (coordination, editing, facilitation) and include mitigation or compensation plans in resource maps.

See compensation model suggestions in Harmonic Scaling templates.

---

## Privacy, IP & legal considerations

- Data practices: minimize collection; define retention; role‑based access.  
- IP: contributors retain authorship but license artifacts according to the project defaults.  
- Legal: collect organizational contacts for partner agreements and ensure partners accept liability/terms where appropriate.

Consult legal counsel for formal partnership contracts or when handling sensitive data.

---

## Example engagement scenarios

- Local library partners to host a 4‑week cohort: run partner intake → onboarding call → dry run → Pilot Playbook micro‑pilot → synthesis → apply coherence gate.  
- Contributor submits a new facilitation template: open issue → draft PR → ethics/access review → merge with attribution and license.

---

## Signals of healthy collaboration

- Decisions include recorded rationale and named owners.  
- Pilots publish syntheses with anonymized learnings.  
- Partner adaptations are documented and shared as learnings.  
- Accessibility requests are honored and tracked.  
- Feedback loops remain frequent as scale increases.

## Next steps (for stewards and contributors)

- Publish a CONTRIBUTING.md with the flow above and automated issue/PR templates.  
- Create a visible decision log and register current Stewards and their scopes.  
- Run a quarterly partner resonance review and publish anonymized learnings.
