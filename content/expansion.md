# Resonance Expansion System (RES)

The **Resonance Expansion System** is the **architectural backbone** of the Resonance Project.  
It provides a **workflow for turning ideas into resonant fields**, and lived experiences back into generative ideas.

---

## Key Workflows
- **Idea → Field Expansion**  
  - Start with a seed (vision, concept, or myth).  
  - Expand through fractal mapping.  
  - Anchor into lived practices and community systems.  

- **Field → Idea Reflection**  
  - Begin with what is happening in experience.  
  - Map resonance patterns.  
  - Distill them into frameworks or guiding ideas.  

---

## Principles
- **Fractality:** every scale (nano → macro → cosmic) mirrors resonance patterns.  
- **Alignment:** coherence arises when practices align with universal resonance.  
- **Iteration:** resonance evolves through cycles, not linear plans.  

---

## Purpose
The RES is both:
- A **map** for tracking resonance across systems.  
- A **practice** for consciously expanding resonance into every domain of life.

> structured enough to hold form, fluid enough to adapt in harmony.*
