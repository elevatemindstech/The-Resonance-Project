# The Resonance Project

**Resonance is the field of alignment that underlies life.**  
The Resonance Project is a living notebook exploring how resonance shapes **language, wellness, systems, and collective evolution**.

This is not a static site, but an **evolving field**. Here we document frameworks, practices, and insights that are unfolding in real-time.
