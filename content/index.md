# Start Here

Welcome. This garden grows through steady, humane steps—aligning vision, practice, and system.

## Quick Start

- Read the arc → [Five Phases](./phases.md)
- See the scaffolding → [Core Frameworks](Frameworks%20draft.md)
- Follow the flow → [Idea-to-Field Workflow](./workflow.md)

## Resonance Statement

- We cultivate coherence through small, reversible steps.
- We honor pace, consent, and feedback as we scale.
- We favor clarity, inclusion, and care over speed.

## What This Is

- A living blueprint and practice library for resonance-based work.
- Lightweight tools to turn insight into humane, testable action.

## What This Is Not

- Not a rigid methodology or one-size-fits-all playbook.
- Not urgency-driven or extractive.

## How to Use This Site

1) Orient: skim [Phases](./phases.md) and [Frameworks](Frameworks%20draft.md).  
2) Choose one action: run a micro‑practice or a tiny pilot → see [Pilot Playbook](./pilot-playbook.md).  
3) Reflect and iterate: log signals → see [Resonance Metrics](./resonance-metrics.md).
