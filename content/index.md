> **As of • Last Quarter (Integration)**  
> We’re integrating the core: **Philosophy** (why/how we move) and **Manifested Works** (what this looks like in practice). Start here, then follow the five-phase arc.

# Start Here

Welcome. This hub brings **clarity, coherence, and care** to how ideas become reality—at human scale and beyond.

## Why begin with Philosophy
Our **Resonance-Based Philosophy** is the backbone—ten principles (Resonance, Relationality, Embodiment, Non-Duality, Inscendence, Cycles & Rhythm, Fractality & Scaling, Integration, Reciprocity, Imagination & Mythic Realism) that keep depth and accessibility in dialogue.  
→ Read: **[Resonance-Based Philosophy](philosophy.md)**

## What “Manifested Works” gives you
This is where the frameworks breathe—**applied systems** you can see, sense, and build with (e.g., RES as a universal backbone, RBWS for embodied coherence, RBFF for reciprocity-aligned finance, Language→Reality for field-shaping, Myth Embodied in development).  
→ Explore: **[Manifested Works](manifested%20works.md)**

## Quick Path

1. **Philosophy** → orient to the ten principles.  
   → [philosophy](philosophy.md)
2. **Manifested Works** → see what’s active now.  
   → [manifested works](manifested%20works.md)
3. **Movement** → learn the five-phase arc and the two flows (Idea→Field / Field→Idea).  
   → [phases](phases.md) · [workflow](workflow.md)
4. **Roadmap & Contribute** → what’s Now/Near/Mid/Long and how to propose pilots.  
   → [roadmap](roadmap.md) · [contribute](contribute.md)

## Navigate

- Workflow → [Idea-to-Field](workflow.md)
- Practices → [Pilot Playbook](pilot-playbook.md)
- Signals → [Resonance Metrics](resonance-metrics.md)
- People → [Engagement & Collaboration](collaboration.md)
- Edges → [Barriers and Bridges](barriers-and-bridges.md)
- Language → [Glossary](glossary.md) • [FAQ](faq.md)
- Mapping → [Unified Dimensions](unified%20dimensions.md)

## Notes on Rhythm
We align integration to the **moon-cycle** conceptually (New / First / Full / Last). The site reflects that rhythm in **orientation**, not as a live log.
