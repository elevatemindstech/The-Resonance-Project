# Core Frameworks

This page is the hub. It orients you to the essential lenses that keep purpose, practice, and scale in tune. Use the decision guide below to pick a lens, then follow the lightweight steps and outputs. Each framework links to deeper pages or practices.

## Framework Constellation (at a glance)

- Unified Dimensions — map context and intent across eight lenses → [Unified Dimensions](Unified%20Dimensions.md)
- Idea‑to‑Field Expansion — turn a spark into a system through five phases → [Workflow](./workflow.md)
- Field‑to‑Idea Manifestation — start from the field; let conditions shape the idea → see [Workflow](./workflow.md)
- Five Phases of Resonance Expansion — the arc that ties it together → [Phases](./phases.md)
- Nano‑to‑Cosmic Scaling — grow across levels without value drift → [Harmonic Scaling](./harmonic-scaling.md)
- Resonance Signals & Metrics — sense alignment with mirrors, not masters → [Resonance Metrics](./resonance-metrics.md)
- Inclusion & Access — make participation humane and reachable → [Inclusion and Access](./inclusion-and-access.md)
- Barriers & Bridges — meet people where they are → [Barriers and Bridges](./barriers-and-bridges.md)
- Collaboration & Governance — decisions, roles, and licensing → [Engagement & Collaboration](./collaboration.md)

## Decision Guide: Which lens now?

- “We need clarity.” → Unified Dimensions
- “We want to move from idea to action.” → Idea‑to‑Field Expansion
- “The field is speaking; what wants to emerge?” → Field‑to‑Idea Manifestation
- “We’re ready to grow but fear drift.” → Nano‑to‑Cosmic Scaling
- “We need to sense if it’s working.” → Resonance Signals & Metrics
- “We must ensure care and access.” → Inclusion & Access + Barriers & Bridges
- “Who decides what?” → Collaboration & Governance

## Unified Dimensions (mapping lens)

### What it is
An eight‑lens map aligning Why, What, and How with added clarity from Who, Opportunities, Interconnections, Where, and When.

### Use when
- Early exploration, pre‑design reviews, pre‑scaling checks.

### Inputs
- A draft resonance statement; current questions and constraints.

### Outputs
- One‑page map, 3 leverage points, 1 smallest next step (owner + timebox).

### Quick steps
1) Diverge notes by lens (no editing).  
2) Converge themes; mark dependencies/risks.  
3) Align leverage points and next step; save a snapshot.

## Idea‑to‑Field Expansion (pathway)

### What it is
A cyclical workflow: Ignition → Exploration → Structuring → Integration → Harmonic Scaling. Turns inspiration into aligned systems.

### Use when
- Starting, rebooting, or needing disciplined momentum.

### Core gates
- Ignition: “done for now” + smallest next step.
- Exploration: 3 insights + 1 next step.
- Structuring: owner + timebox + success criteria per prototype.
- Integration: keep/change/stop decision with rationale.
- Scaling: coherence check passes; risks mitigated.

### Outputs
Resonance statement, UD map, prototype briefs, consent/access checklist, pilot reports, scaling guide.

Deep dive → [Workflow](./workflow.md) • Arc → [Phases](./phases.md)

## Field‑to‑Idea Manifestation (field‑first pathway)

### What it is
Reverses the usual flow by drawing directly from the field (conditions, trends, needs) so concepts are grounded in context and relevance.

### Use when
- You sense opportunities in an ecosystem and want the field to shape the idea.

### Moves (lightweight)
1) Explore the landscape (signals, collaborators, gaps).  
2) Harvest opportunities (name leverage points with clear beneficiaries).  
3) Shape minimal concepts (constraints explicit; ethics in view).  
4) Test micro‑experiments (2–4 weeks; consent and access honored).  
5) Integrate learnings back into the Five Phases.

### Outputs
Opportunity brief(s), minimal concepts, pilot micro‑reports, updated UD map.

See complementary flow → [Workflow](./workflow.md)

## Nano‑to‑Cosmic Scaling (growth lens)

### What it is
A coherence lens across levels: nano → micro → meso → macro → cosmic.

### Use when
- You’re preparing to expand a working pattern or partnership.

### Patterns
- Fractal design (replicate small coherent units with local autonomy).
- Protocol over prescription (minimum viable standards; freedom at the edges).
- Partner resonance (align values, pace, and care).

### Coherence checks
Value drift • Feedback density • Energy economics (capacity vs scope).

Deep dive → [Harmonic Scaling](./harmonic-scaling.md)

---

## Resonance Signals & Metrics (sensemaking lens)

### What it is
Mixed‑methods sensing: qualitative signals + quantitative proxies + boundary (do‑no‑harm) metrics.

### Use when
- Weekly reviews, pilot decisions, pre‑scaling checks.

### Pattern
- 3 signals (felt/behavioral), 3 proxies (counts/latency), 2 boundary metrics (safety/energy).

### Cautions
Mirrors, not masters; pair numbers with narrative.

Deep dive → [Resonance Metrics](./resonance-metrics.md)

---

## Inclusion & Access (care lens)

### What it is
Principles and practices to welcome diverse participation and protect energy.

### Use when
- Always; especially at design, consent, and facilitation moments.

### Core practices
Plain‑language summaries • Multi‑format content • Trauma‑informed options • Accessibility by default.

Details → [Inclusion and Access](./inclusion-and-access.md) • Bridges → [Barriers and Bridges](./barriers-and-bridges.md)

---

## Collaboration & Governance (coordination lens)

### What it is
Lightweight participation paths, decision protocols, and licensing norms.

### Use when
- Defining roles, making shared policies, or partnering.

### Defaults
Advice process for most choices • Consent‑based for shared policies • RACI when clarity is needed.  
Licensing: CC BY 4.0 (content), MIT/Apache‑2.0 (templates/code).

## Interoperability Map (how they fit together)

1) Map → Unified Dimensions  
2) Move → Idea‑to‑Field (or Field‑to‑Idea)  
3) Sense → Resonance Signals & Metrics  
4) Grow → Nano‑to‑Cosmic Scaling  
5) Care → Inclusion & Access + Barriers & Bridges  
6) Hold → Collaboration & Governance

Practical loop: Map → Prototype → Pilot → Sense → Scale/Refine.

---

## Readiness Checklist (before decisions or scaling)

- Purpose clear (Why) and outcomes explicit (What)
- Practices/governance/feedback named (How)
- Roles and capacities identified (Who)
- Context and timing aligned (Where/When)
- Access, consent, and ethics addressed
- 3‑3‑2 metrics selected (signals, proxies, boundary)
- Smallest next step owned and timeboxed
