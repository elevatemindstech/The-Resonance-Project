# Glossary

A concise reference of key terms used across this site. Definitions emphasize practical meaning and how to use the term in practice. Where helpful, links point to deeper pages.

---

## Alignment terms

Resonance
- Meaning: A felt and observable alignment across purpose, practice, and system that supports coherent action and durable outcomes.
- Use: Check whether decisions reference the resonance statement; treat it as a north star.

Resonance statement
- Meaning: A short, clear articulation of intent and core values for a project or initiative.
- Use: Place at the top of maps, briefs, and decision gates to test coherence.

Coherence check
- Meaning: A lightweight decision review that ensures actions remain aligned to the resonance statement, preserve feedback density, and respect capacity.
- Use: Apply at gates before scaling or key decisions.

Feedback density
- Meaning: The frequency and quality of feedback loops that allow rapid learning (e.g., weekly signals, monthly synthesis).
- Use: Track and preserve as you scale; loss of feedback density signals risk.

Energy economics
- Meaning: The relationship between scope/expectations and the real capacity/resources available (time, compensation, attention).
- Use: Match commitments to resourcing; avoid incremental unpaid labor as scope grows.

## Frameworks & workflows

Unified Dimensions Framework
- Meaning: An eight-lens mapping tool (Why, What, How, Who, Opportunities, Interconnections, Where, When) for clarifying context, gaps, and next steps.
- Use: Run as a 60–90 minute mapping session early or before major decisions. See → Unified Dimensions.

Idea‑to‑Field Expansion (Workflow)
- Meaning: The five‑phase pathway (Ignition → Exploration → Structuring → Integration → Harmonic Scaling) for turning ideas into sustainable field practices.
- Use: Follow phases as iterative loops; use gates to decide when to move forward.

Five Phases of Resonance Expansion
- Meaning: The arc that organizes the workflow into phases with specific outputs and gates.
- Use: Reference phase-specific gates and artifacts when planning sprints. See → Phases.

Harmonic Scaling / Nano‑to‑Cosmic Scaling
- Meaning: A lens and playbook for scaling across levels—from nano (individual) to cosmic (field/policy)—while protecting coherence.
- Use: Use scale bands and coherence checks when preparing to grow or partner. See → Harmonic Scaling.

Fractal design
- Meaning: Designing a small, repeatable unit (the fractal) that can be replicated with local autonomy and consistent minimal standards.
- Use: Define the fractal spec (one‑pager) before broad replication.

Field‑to‑Idea Manifestation
- Meaning: A complementary flow that begins by sensing field signals and letting context shape concepts and pilots.
- Use: Use when starting from external signals rather than internal ideas.

## Experiments & evidence

Pilot
- Meaning: A timeboxed, reversible experiment intended to surface learning with minimal risk.
- Use: Run pilots using the Pilot Playbook; publish syntheses.

Pilot Playbook
- Meaning: The guide and templates for designing, running, and synthesizing pilots with attention to consent, access, and ethics.
- Use: Use the YAML pilot brief and 3‑3‑2 metrics template for every pilot. See → Pilot Playbook.

Synthesis (Pilot Synthesis)
- Meaning: A structured summary of what happened, signals, metrics, insights, and the keep/change/stop/scale decision.
- Use: Publish syntheses publicly with anonymized data where possible.

Signals (qualitative)
- Meaning: Felt and behavioral indicators of alignment (ease, stories, invitations).
- Use: Track weekly using light check-ins and pair with narratives.

Proxies (quantitative)
- Meaning: Numeric measures that stand in for alignment (retention, decision latency, rework rate).
- Use: Use as complements to signals; avoid metric worship.

Boundary metrics (do‑no‑harm)
- Meaning: Safety and harm indicators (opt‑outs, incident counts, burnout signs).
- Use: Monitor proactively and treat as gating issues.

3‑3‑2 pattern
- Meaning: Recommended minimum dashboard: 3 signals (qual), 3 proxies (quant), 2 boundary metrics (harm).
- Use: Keep dashboards small and meaningful.

## Participation, ethics & access

Consent
- Meaning: Clear, plain‑language agreement to participate that includes purpose, activities, risks, data use, and opt‑out mechanisms.
- Use: Provide consent language for every pilot and public activity.

Inclusion & Access
- Meaning: Practices and design choices that make participation reachable (plain language, captions, low‑bandwidth alternatives, trauma‑informed options).
- Use: Default to inclusion in all templates and process designs. See → Inclusion & Access.

Ethics / Ethics reviewer
- Meaning: An assigned role or checklist ensuring the pilot/practice respects consent, reduces harm, and protects data/privacy.
- Use: Include an ethics/access reviewer on pilot briefs.

Sovereignty
- Meaning: Respecting participant agency, pace, and the right to withdraw or decline participation.
- Use: Design reversible engagements and alternatives.

---

## Coordination & governance

Decision owner
- Meaning: The accountable person for a scope, gate, or prototype.
- Use: Name an owner for every prototype and gate.

Advice process
- Meaning: A lightweight decision protocol where people seek advice but the owner retains final accountability.
- Use: Default for many operational choices.

Consent‑based decisions
- Meaning: Decisions that require active consent from those affected (not just advice).
- Use: Use for policies, shared norms, or anything affecting broad participation.

RACI
- Meaning: Responsibility matrix (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed).
- Use: Use when roles or handoffs require explicit clarity.

Partner resonance
- Meaning: The alignment check run with prospective partners to ensure values, pace, access, and resource commitments are compatible.
- Use: Run a partner intake checklist before any onboarding.

Licensing
- Meaning: Recommended licenses for content and artifacts (e.g., CC BY 4.0 for content; MIT or Apache‑2.0 for templates/code).
- Use: State license on contributed content and templates. See → Engagement & Collaboration.

## Practical prompts (how to use this glossary)

- If a term appears ambiguous in planning, cite its glossary definition in the decision note to create shared semantics.  
- When starting a new initiative, create a one‑line resonance statement and link this glossary and the Unified Dimensions map in the brief.  
- Use the 3‑3‑2 metrics pattern in every pilot brief to keep measurement small and meaningful.  
- Before scaling, run the coherence checklist from Harmonic Scaling and publish the partner resonance intake.

## Document & update policy

- This glossary is living: update definitions when practices or governance change.  
- When adding a new term, include a short usage note and a link to a page or template that operationalizes it.
