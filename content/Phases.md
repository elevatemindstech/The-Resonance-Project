# Five Phases of Resonance Expansion

A clear, iterative arc for moving from initial alignment to sustainable growth. The phases loop—expect continual feedback, refinement, and learning.

## Overview

- Phases: Ignition → Exploration → Structuring → Integration → Harmonic Scaling
- Nature: Cyclical and non‑linear; feedback may return you to earlier phases
- Aim: Keep Why–What–How aligned while evolving with the field

---

## 1) Ignition (Core Alignment)

- Key activities
  - Clarify purpose and values; craft a concise resonance statement
  - Name motivations, boundaries, and initial scope (“done for now”)
- Outputs
  - Resonance statement
  - Smallest next step and a 2–4 week window
- Gate (move when)
  - Team shares “done for now” and commits to one next step

## 2) Exploration (Resonance Mapping)

- Key activities
  - Map context using the Unified Dimensions (Why, What, How, Who, Opportunities, Interconnections, Where, When)
  - Scan the field, identify collaborators, surface risks and leverage points
- Outputs
  - Context map
  - Three actionable insights and one smallest next step
- Gate (move when)
  - Insights are clear; a minimal step is chosen

## 3) Structuring (Designing Resonant Systems)

- Key activities
  - Translate insights into prototypes, roles, and minimal success criteria
  - Make governance explicit (decision owner, advice/consent), and plan for access and ethics
- Outputs
  - Prototype briefs; action plan; consent/access checklist
- Gate (move when)
  - Each prototype has a timebox, owner, and success criteria

---

## 4) Integration (Iterative Growth)

- Key activities
  - Run small pilots; collect qualitative signals and quantitative proxies
  - Host resonance reviews; decide keep/change/stop
- Outputs
  - Pilot report; learning log; refined artifacts
- Gate (move when)
  - A documented refine‑or‑scale decision with rationale

---

## 5) Harmonic Scaling (Resonance Across Levels)

- Key activities
  - Codify protocols; align partners; monitor value drift and energy economics
  - Preserve feedback density and consent as scope grows
- Outputs
  - Scaling guide; partner criteria; coherence checklist
- Gate (move when)
  - Coherence check passes; risks mitigated; partner alignment confirmed

## Common Feedback Loops

- Ignition ↔ Exploration: Revisit purpose when new realities surface
- Structuring ↔ Integration: Tighten prototypes from pilot learnings
- Integration ↔ Scaling: Pause scaling if coherence or access degrades

Diagram notes
- Structure: Circle with five equal arcs, clockwise arrows; feedback arrows to prior phases
- Visual cues: Distinct colors per phase; small icons (spark, compass, blueprint, spiral, wave)
- Purpose: Emphasize iteration; aid memory; support visual learners; bridge text to graphic
